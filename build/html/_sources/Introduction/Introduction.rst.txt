MISLAND Africa is an operational instrument relying on the international standards for reporting SDG 15.3.1 and technical approaches allowing the delivery of regular information on vegetation cover gain/loss to decision makers and environmental agencies at the first place.

The core-service provides land degradation indicators for Five African regions at two levels:

	- At the regional level where low and medium resolution EO are used.

	- At the pilot site level, where(customized indicators) can be developed, using medium resoultion data(landsat time series imagery and derived vegetation indices, combined with different satellite-derived climate data)
